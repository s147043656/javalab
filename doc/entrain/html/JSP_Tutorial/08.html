JSP Tags</h2>
Another important syntax element of JSP are tags.&nbsp; JSP tags do not
use <b><tt>&lt;%</tt></b>, but just the <b><tt>&lt;</tt></b> character.&nbsp;
A JSP tag is somewhat like an HTML tag.&nbsp; JSP tags can have a "start
tag", a "tag body" and an "end tag".&nbsp; The start and end tag both use
the tag name, enclosed in <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> characters.&nbsp;
The end starts with a <tt>/</tt> character after the <tt>&lt;</tt> character.&nbsp;
The tag names have an embedded colon character <tt>:</tt> in them, the
part before the colon describes the type of the tag.&nbsp; For instance:
<pre>&lt;some:tag&gt;
body
&lt;/some:tag&gt;</pre>
If the tag does not require a body, the start and end can be conveniently
merged together, as
<pre>&lt;some:tag/&gt;</pre>
Here by closing the start tag with a /&gt; instead of &gt; character, we are
ending the tag immediately, and without a body.&nbsp; (This syntax convention
is the the same as XML.)
<p>Tags can be of two types: loaded from an external tag library, or predefined
tags.&nbsp;&nbsp; Predefined tags start with <b><tt>jsp:</tt></b> characters.&nbsp;
For instance, <tt>jsp:include</tt> is a predefined tag that is used to
include other pages.
</p><p>We have already seen the <tt>include</tt> directive.&nbsp; jsp:include
is similar.&nbsp; But instead of loading the text of the included file
in the original file, it actually calls the included target at run-time
(the way a browser would call the included target.&nbsp; In practice, this
is actually a simulated request rather than a full round-trip between the
browser and the server).&nbsp; Following is an example of <tt>jsp:include</tt>
usage
</p><pre>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
Going to include hello.jsp...&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;jsp:include page="hello.jsp"/&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</pre>
Try it and see what you get.&nbsp; Now change the "<tt>jsp:include</tt>"
to "<tt>jsp:forward</tt>" and see what is the difference.&nbsp; These two
predefined tags are frequently very useful.
<p><i>Exercise:</i>&nbsp; Write a JSP to do either a <tt>forward</tt> or
an <tt>include</tt>, depending upon a boolean variable (hint:&nbsp; The
concepts of mixing HTML and scriptlets work with JSP tags also!)
