<h2>
Scriptlets</h2>
We have already seen how to embed Java expressions in JSP pages by putting
them between the <b><tt>&lt;%=</tt></b> and <b><tt>%&gt;</tt></b> character
sequences.
<p>But it is difficult to do much programming just by putting Java expressions
inside HTML.
</p><p>JSP also allows you to write blocks of Java code inside the JSP.&nbsp;
You do this by placing your Java code between <b><tt>&lt;%</tt></b> and
<b><tt>%&gt;</tt></b>
characters (just like expressions, but without the <b><tt>=</tt></b> sign
at the start of the sequence.)
</p><p>This block of code is known as a "scriptlet".&nbsp; By itself, a scriptlet
doesn't contribute any HTML (though it can, as we will see down below.)&nbsp;
A scriptlet contains Java code that is executed every time the JSP is invoked.&nbsp;
</p><p>Here is a modified version of our JSP from previous section, adding
in a scriptlet.
</p><pre>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // This is a scriptlet.&nbsp; Notice that the "date"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // variable we declare here is available in the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // embedded expression later on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println( "Evaluating date now" );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java.util.Date date = new java.util.Date();
%&gt;
Hello!&nbsp; The time is now &lt;%= date %&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</pre>
If you run the above example, you will notice the output from the "<tt>System.out.println</tt>"
on the server log.&nbsp; This is a convenient way to do simple debugging
(some servers also have techniques of debugging the JSP in the IDE.&nbsp;
See your server's documentation to see if it offers such a technique.)
<p>By itself a scriptlet does not generate HTML.&nbsp; If a scriptlet wants
to generate HTML, it can use a variable called "<tt>out</tt>".&nbsp; This
variable does not need to be declared.&nbsp; It is already predefined for
scriptlets, along with some other variables.&nbsp; The following example
shows how the scriptlet can generate HTML output.
</p><pre>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // This scriptlet declares and initializes "date"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println( "Evaluating date now" );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java.util.Date date = new java.util.Date();
%&gt;
Hello!&nbsp; The time is now
&lt;%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // This scriptlet generates HTML output
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out.println( String.valueOf( date ));
%&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</pre>
Here, instead of using an expression, we are generating the HTML directly
by printing to the "<tt>out</tt>" variable.&nbsp; The "<tt>out</tt>" variable
is of type <tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.2/javadoc/javax/servlet/jsp/JspWriter.html">javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter</a>.</tt>
<p>Another very useful pre-defined variable is "<tt>request</tt>".&nbsp;
It is of type <tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.1/api/javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.html">javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest</a></tt>
</p><p>A "request" in server-side processing refers to the transaction between
a browser and the server.&nbsp; When someone clicks or enters a URL, the
browser sends a "request" to the server for that URL, and shows the data
returned.&nbsp; As a part of this "request", various data is available,
including the file the browser wants from the server, and if the request
is coming from pressing a SUBMIT button, the information the user has entered
in the form fields.
</p><p>The JSP "<tt>request</tt>" variable is used to obtain information from
the request as sent by the browser.&nbsp; For instance, you can find out
the name of the client's host (if available, otherwise the IP address will
be returned.)&nbsp; Let us modify the code as shown:
</p><pre>&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // This scriptlet declares and initializes "date"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println( "Evaluating date now" );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java.util.Date date = new java.util.Date();
%&gt;
Hello!&nbsp; The time is now
&lt;%
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out.println( date );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out.println( "&lt;BR&gt;Your machine's address is " );
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out.println( request.getRemoteHost());
%&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;</pre>
A similar variable is "response".&nbsp; This can be used to affect the
response being sent to the browser.&nbsp; For instance, you can call <tt>response.sendRedirect(
anotherUrl ); </tt>to send a response to the browser that it should load
a different URL.&nbsp; This response will actualy go all the way to the
browser.&nbsp; The browser will then send a different request, to "<tt>anotherUrl</tt>".&nbsp;
This is a little different from some other JSP mechanisms we will come
across, for including another page or forwarding the browser to another
page.
<p><i>Exercise:</i>&nbsp; Write a JSP to output the entire line, "Hello!&nbsp;
The time is now ..." but use a scriptlet for the complete string, including
the HTML tags.
