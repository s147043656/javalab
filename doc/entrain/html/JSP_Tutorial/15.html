Further learning</h2>
The JSP tutorial presented here covers the most useful JSP programming
constructs.&nbsp; The tutorial is focused on being practical and simple,
therefore not all details have been covered.
<h3>
Specifications</h3>
When you are comfortable with JSPs and ready to tackle more details, you
may find it useful to download the JSP specifications from <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/">Sun's
JSP page</a>.&nbsp; There is also a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/pdf/card11.pdf">JSP
quick reference card</a> available from this site that can be handy to
print out and keep.
<p>An item to note is that JSP's eventually are turned into servlets, and
though JSPs are much simpler than servlets, for some cases servlets are
still useful.&nbsp; Therefore you may want to also learn about <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/">servlets</a>.
</p><h3>
Interface Definitions</h3>
If you need to know exactly how to do some particular thing in JSP, e.g.
how to get the remote user's machine name, or the query string, or how
to re-direct the user's browser to a different page, or some similar thing,
one good place to start looking is in these interface definitions:
<blockquote><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.1/api/javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.html">javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest</a>
<br><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.1/api/javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse.html">javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse</a>
<br><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.2/javadoc/javax/servlet/jsp/JspWriter.html">javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter</a>
<br><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.2/javadoc/javax/servlet/jsp/PageContext.html">javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext</a></blockquote>

as winforms - that is to say, just by handling events like button clicks as you would in a desktop program.
