<h2>
Protecting your website with a login page</h2>
Some sites require that all users log-in using a username and password,
before being able to visit any page.
<p>This can be done using JSP sessions or servlets, and in fact this was
a common technique for a while.&nbsp; But starting with a new release of
Servlets specifications (2.2) from Sun, this feature is now very simple
to implement.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p><p>It is no longer necessary to use JSP techniques to provide login/password
protection, but it is still a very common requirement of web-sites, therefore
a brief overview is provided here.
</p><p>To password-protect your site, you just need to design a login page.&nbsp;
This page can be as simple or complicated as you need it to be.&nbsp; It
must contain a <tt>&lt;FORM&gt;</tt> tag, with the <tt>METHOD</tt> set to
<tt>POST</tt> and the <tt>ACTION</tt> set to "<tt>j_security_check</tt>".<tt></tt>
</p><p><tt>&lt;FORM METHOD=POST ACTION=j_security_check&gt;</tt>
</p><p>The target <tt>j_security_check</tt> is provided by the application
server, and does not need to be coded.
</p><p>The form must contain two <tt>&lt;INPUT&gt;</tt> fields, named <tt>j_username</tt>
and <tt>j_password</tt> respectively for the username and password.&nbsp;
Typically, the username field will be a <tt>TEXT</tt> input field, and
the password field will be a <tt>PASSWORD</tt> input field.
</p><p>After this, you must tell your application server to password protect
your pages using the login page you have provided.&nbsp; The details will
vary from server to server, but a good implementation will provide you
hooks that you can use, for example, to match usernames and passwords against
a database.&nbsp; (E.g., in Blazix you can supply an implementation of
the interface <tt>desisoft.deploy.AuthCheck</tt> to check usernames and
passwords against a database or other sources.)
